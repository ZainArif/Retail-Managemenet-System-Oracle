Scenario:
The system should be able to keep record of day to day transactions producing bills for customers and invoices for suppliers. 
The System should contain records of the following parties.
1)	Employees
2)	Departments 
3)	Products
4)	Suppliers
5)	Bills
6)	Invoices
7)	Sales
8)	Purchase orders
9)	Customers 

In addition the system must be able to provide answers to questions such as listed below. The aim is to reduce redundancy and achieve efficiency and reliability.
Departments:
The store has several departments such As 
1)	Clothing.
2)	Cosmetics.
3)	Grocery.
4)	Toys.

But the system is modelled around the Sales department so as to monitor all products going in and out of the store. This enables us to create a system that is not confined to a particular product or department and is universally functional. The sales department monitors the sale and purchase as well as order of new products in the store.
